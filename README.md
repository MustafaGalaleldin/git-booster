This shell script decreases your working-time by exchanging the sequence of pushing new edits into github with one command instead of doing :
git add .
git commit -m "error fixed"
git push

note:
this script works without problems in case you want to push at the same  branch that was edited and you do not want to change commit messege from the mentioned one.
the script will add all new modifications.
